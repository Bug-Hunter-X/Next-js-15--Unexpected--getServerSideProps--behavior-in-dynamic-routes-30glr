# Next.js 15 Bug Report: Unexpected getServerSideProps Behavior

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior encountered when using `getServerSideProps` within a Next.js 15 App Router page featuring dynamic routes. The issue arises when attempting to utilize data fetched within `getServerSideProps` to render the page's content.  The expected behavior is for the data to populate the page's components; however, the actual behavior falls short of this expectation.  This leads to unpredictable rendering behavior and missing data on the client-side.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to a dynamic route (e.g., `/posts/1`).
5. Observe the console output and the rendered page content. The console might show that the data is fetched correctly, but not rendered on the page.

## Expected Behavior

The page should render correctly using data fetched within `getServerSideProps`.  The console logs should clearly indicate that data is not only fetched but properly used during the rendering process.

## Actual Behavior

The page does not render correctly, potentially showing default content or placeholders instead of the intended content populated from `getServerSideProps`. The console logs might not align with the visual output of the page, suggesting a mismatch between data fetching and page rendering.
